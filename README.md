# Daily Dairy App

This app is Alexis Morcrette's solution to the Makers Academy Daily Diary App practical about databases.

## Scenario

I enjoy keeping a journal, and I want to store this online in my very own 'Daily Diary' application.

As a busy coach I'm a bit short on time, so I've provided user stories below so you can build one for me. Your challenge is to build a 'Daily Diary' application that uses Sinatra together with a PostgreSQL to store diary entries, and has a browser-based user interface.

I've included some extra functionality options, so the user requirements are split into 'Must have', 'Should have' and 'Could have'.

If you can think if any other cool features then feel free to add them ðŸ˜ƒ

## Getting started

`git clone path-to-your-repo`

## Usage

`command_to_start` (e.g. `rackup` or `rails s`)
Navigate to `http://localhost:4567/`


## Running tests

At the barest minimum, it should contain a description of what the code does, how to install it, how to use it and how to run its tests. In addition, READMEs often include other information such as:

- Configuration instructions
- A file manifest (list of files included)
- Copyright and licensing information
- Contact information for the distributor or programmer
- Known bugs
- Troubleshooting
- Credits and acknowledgments
- A changelog (usually for programmers)
